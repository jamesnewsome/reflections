When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I beleive it would be useful to use a remote repository if your working with others, or you want to share your work. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may be working on some changes that you may not wish to add to your code, that may be present on GIT.
