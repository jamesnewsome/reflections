How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was really helpful, and the mistake stood out right away. Rather than trying to go line by line I could see how this would be difficult for production level code. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be much easir to find bugs, see channges and track which channges are made the most. This data may help when creating new applications in the future. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are if you are working on a team, you can establish a consistent practice. The cons maybe that you will have to adapt how you think about coding if the practice is different from how you normally do it. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	I would beleive its based on why they were created, Google Docs were created to be more of a file system.
